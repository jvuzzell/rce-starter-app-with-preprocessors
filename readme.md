# RCE Starter App w/ Build Process
Welcome to the RCE App Starter project, a robust development template for building scalable and efficient web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the power of Webpack and npm. 

## Demo
![RCE Framework Demo](/docs/assets/20240413_rce-basic-site-demo.gif "RCE Framework Demo")

## Features

- **SASS for styles**: Organized into functional stylesheets for easy maintenance.
- **Component-based architecture**: Modular JavaScript for scalable development.
- **Automated builds**: Configured Webpack to handle assets, styles, and transpilation.
- **Hot reloading**: Streamlines the development process by reloading only parts of the application that change.

The RCE App Starter contains a SCSS style guide (framework) and a Javascript state management framework named RCE. 

- Documentation regarding the SCSS style guide is pending. Please check back soon.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).

### Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd rce-app-starter
npm install
```

### Running the Project

- **Development mode:** This will start a dev server with hot reloading.
```bash
npm start
``` 
- **Build the project:** This will compile all resources for production into the `public` directory. 
```bash
npm run build
```

- **Watch Mode:** Listens for any changes and rebuilds the project as needed.
```bash
npm run watch
```

- **Deploy:** Run the deployment script.
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Development

#### Adding a New Page
Create a new HTML and corresponding JS file in the `src/pages/` directory.

#### Styles
Base styles, utilities, components, and layout-specific styles are placed in respective folders within `src/styles/`.
Use the `main.scss` file to import other stylesheets.

#### Components
JavaScript components are located in `src/components/`.
Each component should be modular and reusable across different parts of the application.
